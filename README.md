# Power Menu Opener
Power Menu Opener is a small app / code sample that opens androids power button menu via accessability features.
It was just made for learning practices.
## Objektives
 - Open power menu without pressing the power button, to increase accessibility and expend the lifetime of the button
 - Use an android shortcut that can be integrated in launchers (in my example the Microsoft Launcher)
